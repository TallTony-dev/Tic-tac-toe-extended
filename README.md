<h1>'Tic Tac Toe' Extended</h1>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
This is a basic tic tac toe style game where your objective and the objective of your algorithmic opponents is to get n in a row pieces. As opposed to traditional tic tac toe, this board can be up to 26x26, and up to 9 players can play at a time! This can lead to some interesting interactions with various algorithms that can be used to determine how the ai opponents should play. Currently I am using a weighted grid type of system in order to determine the ai's next move, which lends itself quite well to being fed into an evolutionary simulator to determine the best way to play. Though minimax algorithms are optimal, on large boards they can be very expensive, as the possibilities are quite vast. Check out todo.txt for future plans.

<h3>Why?</h3>
This is a project I made in order to consolidate, test, and demonstrate my knowledge of the c programming language, as well as just to have something to do. This started with just a simple objective to make a tic tac toe command line game and quickly fell out of scope, and into a larger project with ai opponents and variably sized boards.
