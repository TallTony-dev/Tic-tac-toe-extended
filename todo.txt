TODO: 
- Implement other ai types (greedy, etc.) (use a variadic func?)
- Implement ai type which calls an general purpose llm to determine next move

STRETCH:
- Implement other rule sets
- Make algorithms reduce weight if a win condition can't be met with a line in a direction (check for blocking and edges)
- Evolution simulation
